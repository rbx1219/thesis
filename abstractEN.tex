Real-valued optimization is a famous problem which has been researched for several decades, and it is also applied to many real-world problems. To conquer the difficulty of infinity searching space , there are many approaches developed to solve the problem. For example, evolution strategies, real-coded genetic algorithm. Evolution strategy (ES) is an optimization technique based on ideas of evolution and self-adaptaion while covariance matrix adaptaion evolution strategy (CMA-ES) is probably best one of the ES family. Real-coded extended compact genetic algorithm (rECGA) is a branch of Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) which replace traditional operators of genetic algorithm, crossover and mutation, with modeling and sampling. This thesis will give a brief introduction for both techniques. The illustrated method in this work is kind of domain discretion. CMA-ES performs well on exploitation, and we want to improve the ability of exploration. To achieve that, we design an algorithm using 2-layer CMA-ES to explore the information extracted from local optima.
